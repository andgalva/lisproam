 			Mobile Host-----
 			
 Differently from the global, this testbeds components are all VMs, apart from the Map-Server/Resolver
 which is hosted in another network.
 Since the OpenWRT are VMs, they cannot be access points, so the WiFi connection and authentication
 dialogue cannot take place.
 The local testbed indeed couldn't reproduce the target scenario of LISP-ROAM...
