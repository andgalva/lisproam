# 1: wpa_supplicant initiates scanning and AP selection
# 0: driver takes care of scanning, AP selection, and IEEE 802.11 association
#    parameters (e.g., WPA IE generation); this mode can also be used with
#    non-WPA drivers when using IEEE 802.1X mode; do not try to associate with
#    APs (i.e., external program needs to control association). This mode must
#    also be used when using wired Ethernet drivers.
# 2: like 0, but associate with APs using security policy and SSID (but not
#    BSSID); this can be used, e.g., with ndiswrapper and NDIS driver to
#    enable operation with hidden SSIDs and optimized roaming; in this mode,
#    only the first network block in the configuration file is used and this
#    configuration should have explicit security policy (i.e., only one option
#    in the lists) for key_mgmt, pairwise, group, proto variables
